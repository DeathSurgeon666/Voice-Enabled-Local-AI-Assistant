# Voice-Enabled-Local-AI-Assistant
Shadow is a personal AI voice assistant built with Python that listens to your voice commands, queries a local AI model via Ollama (e.g., Mistral), and responds back using speech.  It works completely offline (if Ollama is running locally) and allows natural interaction via voice â€” just say "exit" to quit.
